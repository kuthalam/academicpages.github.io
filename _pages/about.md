Hello there! My name is Mukund and I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Northwestern University (NU). I joined the Qualitative Research Group (QRG) led by Dr. Ken Forbus just this year, and my research interest is in knowledge representation, as explored through textual and visual data. I received a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin and a Masters in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology.

As for my free time, I am usually watching shows or playing video games. I occasionally do some sketching as well, particularly of animals.
